# Mass Emailer

A small program for quickly sending a whole bunch of emails from a template. 

- Write your template in email_text.txt
- Include the recipient names and emails in to_send.xlsx
- Run "python email_gen.py" to create an HTML file that assists a user in sending the email text to all of the desired recipients.

In order for the file to properly function, you need to properly configure a desktop email client. It uses emailto links.
